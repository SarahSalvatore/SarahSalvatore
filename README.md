## About Me

I'm a Software Engineer based in Toronto, Canada. With a background in both graphic design and full stack software development, I bring a unique perspective to creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces and clean, efficient applications.

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading a good book or enjoying the great outdoors with my two huskies.
